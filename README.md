# MineSweep

The most aborbing software that MS has ever developed, well... for me, is mine sweep. It is a pity that I had never played it again since I moved away from winxp. So I wrote one for myself.

## Abstraction

Server implementation of the mine sweep web application. It now provides services such as user signup/login, records creation/querying via web APIs.

## Front-end code

The front-end code are developed and maintained in another project [mine-sweep](https://github.com/wolfgangshilei/mine-sweep), and is imported as a submodule of this repository.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on heroku. To play with the live version, please visit [http://mine-sweep-1008.herokuapp.com](http://mine-sweep-1008.herokuapp.com).
